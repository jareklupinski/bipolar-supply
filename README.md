# bipolar-supply
Generates +-15V from a USB-C 5V Jack

The design centers around the TPS65131 chip, which integrates two switching regulators, and outputs a bipolar power supply, handy for opamps and small signal experiments.

Work in progress: tested board outputs +15 and -14V, have to recalculate inverter feedback resistors
